@FF4JServices

Feature: Provides api's to do the following
  - Provide core information on ff4J and available sub resources
  - Display security resources
  - Check if a feature is flipped
  - Initialize a flip strategy and check if the feature has been flipped

  Background:
    Given the feature store is cleared
    And the authorization manager is cleared
    And the following features exists in the feature store
      | uid   | enable | description    | group | permissions          |
      | admin | false  | the admin page | admin | ROLE_ADMIN           |
      | login | true   | the login page | user  | ROLE_ADMIN,ROLE_USER |

  # Provide core information on ff4J and available sub resources
  Scenario: When the user tries to retrieve the ff4j information
    Given the feature store has the following security information
      | currentUserPermissions | allPermissions                    |
      | ROLE_USER              | ROLE_USER,ROLE_SUPPORT,ROLE_ADMIN |
